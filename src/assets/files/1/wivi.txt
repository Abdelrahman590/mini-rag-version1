Slide 2 — The Core Problem
Why Raw Genetic Data Is Not Clinically Useful
Points:
•	Genetic data arrives as numeric allele codes (2, 3, 4)
•	These numbers have no direct clinical meaning
•	Physicians cannot make decisions based on raw allele values
🧠 تشبيه:
•	Blood glucose = 180 ≠ Diagnosis
•	Pixel intensity ≠ Radiology report

Slide 3 — What Clinicians Actually Need
Clinical Perspective vs Technical Representation
Points:
•	Clinicians think in:
o	Risk
o	Protection
o	Severity
•	Medicine works with states, not raw signals
•	Interpretation layer is mandatory
📌 Key Message:
Medicine requires interpretation, not raw data.
